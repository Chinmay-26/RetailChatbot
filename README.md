RetailChatbot
An AI-powered chatbot designed for retail environments—capable of answering product queries, guiding users, and enhancing customer experience through natural language conversation.

🚀 Overview
RetailChatbot is a conversational assistant built to understand and respond to customer questions about products, availability, categories, pricing, and more. By leveraging modern NLP and AI techniques, the bot interprets user intent and delivers helpful, accurate responses rooted in your retail catalog or dataset.

🛠️ Features
Natural Language Interaction: Users can ask questions in plain English—e.g., “Do you have blue sneakers in size 10?”—and receive meaningful replies.

Product Search Capability: Retrieves relevant products based on user queries, such as features, price, or category.

Database-Driven Responses: Connects to your retail dataset to provide real-time product details and availability.

Streamlit (or web UI): An intuitive frontend for chat interactions, optionally backed by frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex.

SQL Generation (Optional): Converts user intent into dynamic SQL queries for retrieving backend data stored in a catalog.

Extensible Design: Modular code makes it easy to tweak prompts, add fine‑tuning, or integrate new data sources.

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
or configure .env or secrets.toml depending on your setup.

🚀 Usage
Run in development mode (via Streamlit or equivalent UI):

Then open http://localhost:8501 (or your local host URL).

Conversational Format: Type in plain English product-related queries, and the bot will reply with responses like:

Product matches or suggestions

Availability and store location

Pricing or promotional offers

🧠 How It Works
Prompt Engineering: prompts.py defines templates to translate customer questions into internal queries (or SQL).

Data Retrieval: query_handler.py executes queries against your catalog (e.g., CSV or SQLite), retrieves product info, and fetches availability.

Response Generation: The bot formats results into conversational replies. If configured with GPT/OpenAI, it may dynamically craft responses to sound natural.

UI Interaction: The frontend (Streamlit or a web interface) handles chat flow and renders suggestions, cards, and product lists.

🧪 Testing & Contribution
Add test cases to validate prompt mapping, query output, and conversational flow.

Expand prompts or categories, adjust data sources, or fine-tune response behavior.

Contributions are welcome via issues or pull requests—especially to enhance prompt templates, integrate embeddings, or support multilingual queries.

🧰 Use Cases
Customer self‑service: Reduce friction by letting customers search for items via chat before making a purchase.

In-store navigation/helper bot: Assist retail staff or customers in finding product information quickly.

Salesbot for small e‑commerce stores: Provide a virtual assistant on your site to handle queries on items, stock, or pricing.
